## Web Automation Using Proxy and Chrome Debug

### 1. Create a script `use-puppeteer-connect.mjs`, which will allow you to connect to a chrome that is running with debug port, and extract title from `example.com`

run the following command to execute the program:

```script
node use-puppeteer-connect.mjs
```

### 2. Create another script `use-browserless.mjs`, which will use browserless to connect to a chrome, and extract title from `example.com`

run the following command to execute the program:

```script
node use-browserless.mjs
```

---

### 3. Create a script `use-proxies.mjs` to print the ip from a ip sharing website, using `webshare`, `proxyscrape` or other `proxies`.

run the following command to execute the program:

```script
node use-proxies.mjs
```

**N.B : At first clone the repository and run `pnpm install`, then set environment variables and then run the programs.**
